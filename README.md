In this project, a credit card fraud detection system has been developed to identify fraudulent transactions using anonymized financial data. Logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest algorithms have been applied to build and compare predictive models. The dataset has been scaled and anonymized to protect user privacy, but key insights have still been extracted through thorough exploratory data analysis. Feature importance has been evaluated, class imbalance has been addressed using under-sampling techniques, and model performance has been assessed through precision, recall, and AUC metrics. The kernel has been continuously refined based on ongoing research, model tuning, and evaluation of emerging techniques in fraud analytics.
